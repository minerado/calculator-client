# Calculator

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js - Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
- You'll have to follow the instructions on the [Elixir Calculator Project](https://github.com/minerado/calculator) to be able to have a running local server.

### Instalation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/minerado/calculator-client.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

`cd calculator-client`

3. Install project dependencies using npm, yarn or pnpm

`npm install`

### Running the Development Server

1. Start the development server:

`npm run dev`

This will launch the Vite.js development server, and your project will be available at http://localhost:5174 in your web browser.

2. Have fun!
